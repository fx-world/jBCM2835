## About This Content

jBCM2835 is a Java Wrapper for the [BCM2835 C library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/) from Mike McCauley. It provides access to the GPIO, I2C and SPI on the Broadcom BCM2835 chip, like it is used in the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). [JNAerator](http://jnaerator.googlecode.com/) was used to generate the initial wrapper class, but it was modified by hand afterwards.
